    **Task**: Extract all entities from the provided text and format them as a JSON array.  
    **Instructions**:  
    1. **Identify New Entities**:  
    - Extract all entities mentioned in the text that are **not already in the provided list below**.  
    - For each new entity, provide:  
        - `name`: The name of the entity (capitalized).  
        - `label`: One of the following labels: [{entity_labels}]. **Do not create new labels unless necessary**.  
        - `description`: A detailed description of the entity's attributes, activities, or context. If no description is available, use an empty string ("").  

    **Output Format**:  
    - Format each entity as a JSON object.  
    - Return all new entities as a JSON array.  
    - **Strictly follow the example format below**:  
    **Example Output**:  
    [
        {{
            "name": "Patient",
            "label": "Person",

    **Rules**:  
    - **Global Entity List**: `[{entity_name}]`The provided list contains all names and labels of each entities you've extracted. Do not add any entities that are already in the list.
    - **Strict Deduplication**: Do not extract any entity that matches (case-insensitively) or is a synonym of an entity in the list above.  
    - **Do not invent entities** that are not explicitly mentioned in the text.  
    - **Do not add new labels unless necessary** outside the provided list: [{entity_labels}].

    1. **Entities Identified** (use ONLY these entities):
    [{entity_name}]

    2. **Relationship Extraction Rules**:
    - **Broad Relationship Scope**: Extract ALL possible relationships, even if weak or indirect.
    - **Key Signals to Capture**:
    - Co-occurrence in the same sentence or adjacent sentences
    - Verb-based interactions (e.g., "treated with", "caused by")
    - Attribute associations (e.g., "level of glucose", "dose of metformin")
    - Implicit connections (e.g., "diabetes" and "hyperglycemia" are clinically related)
    - **Strength Scoring**:
    - 1-3: Weak (e.g., co-occurrence without clear interaction)
    - 4-6: Moderate (e.g., one entity describes another)
    - 7-9: Strong (e.g., direct action or causation)
    - 10: Very Strong (e.g., explicit verb or clinical guideline)

    3. **Output Requirements**:
    - Generate AT LEAST 5 relationships per text (if possible).
    - Include relationships even if they are weak (strength 1-3).
    - If a relationship does not fit the rules, use '""' to fullfill the requirement. Such as "relationship_description": "",
    - Use the following JSON format for each relationship:
    {{
        "source": "<source_entity>",
        "target": "<target_entity>",
        "relationship_label": "<relationship_label>",
        "relationship_description": "<description>",
        "relationship_strength": <strength>

    - Strong Relationship:
    {{
        "source": "metformin",
        "target": "diabetes",
        "relationship_label": "TREATS",
        "relationship_description": "Metformin is prescribed to manage diabetes.",
        "relationship_strength": 9
    }}
    - Weak Relationship:
    {{
